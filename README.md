## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Focus was built with three core principles:

### 1. **Minimalism Meets Sophistication**
Every element serves a purpose. The glassmorphic design adds visual interest without overwhelming the user, creating a premium feel that enhances rather than distracts.

### 2. **Responsive Interactions**
Each interaction—hover, click, completion—is accompanied by carefully crafted animations that provide immediate feedback. The orange glow theme creates warmth and energy, keeping users engaged.

### 3. **Performance First**
Despite rich visual effects, Focus is optimized for smooth performance using `will-change` properties, efficient event delegation, and CSS hardware acceleration.
